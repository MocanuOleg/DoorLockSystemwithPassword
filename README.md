# DoorLockSystemwithPassword

Project Overview
The Door Lock System with Password is a security project designed to control access to a door by requiring a password input. Using a 4x4 matrix keypad, users can enter a predefined password to unlock the door. If the password is entered correctly, the door unlocks briefly. If incorrect passwords are entered multiple times, a buzzer sounds to indicate a lockout.


Components Used
Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno)
4x4 Matrix Keypad: For entering the password.
Green LED: Lights up when the password is correct, indicating access granted.
Red LED: Lights up when the password is incorrect.
Buzzer: Sounds after 3 incorrect attempts to indicate a lockout.
LCD Display: Provides feedback messages, such as "Enter Password", "Access Granted", or "Access Denied".
